# PokemonEvolutionEditorGen1
Edit Pokemon evolutions for generation 1 games.

What the application can currently do:
 - Change existing evolution paths to any Pokémon and with any evolution method available in the first generation of Pokémon games.
    Want to make that weak Caterpie evolve in to a Mewtwo at Level 5? Go for it. Can't trade Pokemon on a ROM? Change the evolution method
    to level up (or a stone!) Welcome to the glory of the Pokemon Evolution Editor for gen 1!
 
What the application can NOT currently do:
  - Add new evolutions for a Pokemon that doesn't have an evolution in the base game. (The application will not tell you this, so be careful)
  - Edit the evolution data for Eevee -> Jolteon or Eevee -> Vaporeon. (Eevee is weird. 
  I haven't figured out how the game knows it has multiple evolutions)
  - Edit evolutions for Yellow version. They changed where the evolution data is stored and I haven't found it yet...
  
This application is currently in it's first release, and as such does not have all of the functionality 
I would like the final version to have.
So... Make sure to back up your ROMs before using this application on them!
